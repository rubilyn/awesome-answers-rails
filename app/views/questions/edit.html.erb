<h1>Edit Question</h1>

<%# When you pass a persisted object to `form_for` then it will use the url to
    the update action which is the same url for the show action
    (question_path(@question)) and it will use PATCH for the verb by using a
    technique of having a hidden field within the form with name `_method` and
    value `PATCH`. Also, all the fields will be prepopulated with data from
    the database. Also, note that the `submit` button will have a different
    text in here which will be `update question` %>


<%= render 'form' %>
